Adds player status icons and a team score comparison to the HUD. This mod must be installed on the server.

Team scores are the accumulated total of all points earned by players while on that team, not just the sum of scores from the current set of players. This means that a team's score is not changed if a player leaves or switches.

Commanders have some extra features:

* Click on a player icon to select that player, then click again to centre the player on-screen
* Player icons turn red as players take damage
* Selected units are highlighted green on the minimap
* Hotkey grouping is more responsive than in vanilla NS2

I made this mod to give players a better understanding of what was happening at a strategic level and to visibly link their personal victories to the team's overall success. I had new players in mind when I started, but the finished product is useful to everyone.

You can configure how much of the new HUD is displayed with the console command `teaminfohud`.
